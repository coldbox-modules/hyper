## A CFML HTTP Builder

### Inspiration

Hyper was built after coding several API SDK's for various platforms â€”
[S3SDK](https://github.com/coldbox-modules/s3sdk),
[cbstripe](https://github.com/coldbox-modules/cbox-stripe), and
[cbgithub](https://github.com/elpete/cbgithub), to name a few. I noticed that I
spent a lot of time setting up the plumbing for the requests and a wrapper
around `cfhttp`. Each implementation was mostly the same but slightly different.
It was additionally frustrating because I really only needed to tweak a few
values, usually just the `Authorization` header. It would be nice to create an
HTTP client pre-configured for each of these SDK's. It seemed the perfect fit
for a module.

### The problem it solves

Hyper exists to provide a fluent builder experience for HTTP requests and responses. It also provides a powerful way to create clients, i.e. Builder objects with pre-configured defaults like a base URL or certain headers.

### Requirements

Hyper runs on Adobe ColdFusion 2018+ and Lucee 5+.

ColdBox is not required, but mappings are provided for ColdBox users automatically.
